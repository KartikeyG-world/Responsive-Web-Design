            <p>Dr. Norman Borlaug was an American agronomist, humanitarian, and Nobel laureate who has been called "the father of the Green Revolution." His work in developing high-yield, disease-resistant wheat varieties led to massive increases in food production and helped alleviate famine in several countries, especially in Asia and Latin America.</p>

            <p>His efforts earned him numerous awards, including the Nobel Peace Prize in 1970, and his legacy continues to influence modern agriculture and food security programs globally.</p>
